# Fargate Task

A set of instructions from your mom on how she wants you to sweep the floors.

## What is a Fargate task?

A Fargate task describes to Fargate what it should do with a container that you've built.

How many isntances of that container should be running at once?
What should Fargate do if a container fails?
What should Fargate do when a container succeds?
Should this task be considered critical to the set of Fargate services that are currently running?

## Why?

- You have a Docker container that can run your application. But that doesn't mean that Fargate knows what it should do with it.
- With a task definition, now Fargate knows how to handle your container.
