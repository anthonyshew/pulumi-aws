# API Container

Location: `/docker/Dockerfile.api`

This container has an Express api in it.
Boring, normal HTTP REST stuff. :)

## Gotchas

- The database needs to get connected up for Prisma to be able to generate its types.
  - This means that the container needs to be supplied with a environment variable for `DATABASE_URL`.

TODO:

- It would be really great if this thing had a read-only database to work against.
- That would keep our production database safer as we migrate against it.
