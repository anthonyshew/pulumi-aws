# Web Container

Location: /docker/Dockerfile.web

This container features a Nextjs server.

## Gotchas

- To pre-render pages, this container needs to be able to connect to a a database.
  - This means that the container needs to be supplied with a environment variable for `DATABASE_URL`.
  - Additionally, that database must be updated with the migration that you intend to be running the application against.

TODO:

- It would be really great if this thing had a read-only database to work against.
- That would keep our production database safer as we migrate against it.
