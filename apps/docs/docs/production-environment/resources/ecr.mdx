# ECR

"My docker containers live here!"

## What is ECR?

ECR stands for "Elastic Container Registry."

If you want to utilize containers for your application, you'll need to have a store for those containers.
This is necessary so that the resources that will run your apps will have a place to fetch the containers from.
