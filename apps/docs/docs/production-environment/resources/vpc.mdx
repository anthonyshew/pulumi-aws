# VPC

## What is a VPC?

VPC stands for "virtual private cloud."

You are already probably familiar with the idea of the cloud in general. There's a ton of computers that are all linked together to create a system of computers that are much more powerful together.

AWS allows you to create your own "cloud within the cloud." In _your_ cloud, you have the ability to create all sorts of resources and relationships for those resources to create your own system of networked computers.

Your VPC is the base of everything you will build in AWS. Everything lives inside of your VPC as if it were the computer sitting right next to you.

## Why use a VPC?

There are a multitude of reasons to understand and use a VPC but these are probably the most prominent:

- Security
  - By default, nothing within your cloud is accessible to the open internet. It's your job to open up ports to the rest of the internet for everyone to be able to utilize the awesome applications that you have built.
  - As far as security goes, this is probably your first line of defense. If you were to never let anyone into your VPC, it would always be ultra-safe, of course. However, we have to open things up so that people can use our cool stuff.
- Scaling Potential
  - You'll never buy as many servers as Amazon. Because of this, we want to rent out however many servers/computers that we need from them.
  - You have the ability to scale up and down for whatever resources you may need at any given moment. This can even be automated!
- Uptime & Consistency
  - Amazon is going to do a better job of keeping consistent uptime than you. If you were to host your apps on your computer at home, all it might take for you to lose everything would be a power outage.
  - AWS has servers all across the world that are built to be redundant so that your apps are probably running nearly 99.% of the time.
  - Disaster recovery is also important. The cloud is built to withstand its own mistakes (and yours) so that if something goes wrong, it should be able to recover without anyone ever noticing.
- "Free" hardware upgrades
  - Unless you want to keep buying the latest and greatest technology, AWS gives you a better chance to keep up with the pace of innovation. You'll rarely have to worry about upgrading your hardware and most of it should happen without you ever noticing.
